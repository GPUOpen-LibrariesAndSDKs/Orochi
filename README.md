## About

"Yamata No Orochi"<sup>[1]</sup> 

Orochi is a library loading HIP and CUDA APIs dynamically, allowing the user to switch APIs at runtime. Therefore you don't need to compile two separate implementations for each API. This allows you to compile and maintain a single binary that can run on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Unlike HIP, which uses hipamd or CUDA at compile-time, Orochi will dynamically load the corresponding HIP/CUDA shared libraries depending on your platform. In other words, it combines the functionality offered by HIPEW and CUEW into a single library.

```

## Requirement

This library doesn't require you to link to CUDA (for the driver APIs) nor HIP (for both driver and runtime APIs) at build-time. This provides the benefit that you don't need to install HIP SDK on your machine or CUDA SDK in case you're not using the runtime APIs. 
To run an application compiled with Orochi, you need to install a driver of your choice with the corresponding .dll/.so files based on the GPU(s) available. Orochi will automatically link with the corresponding shared library at runtime.

## API example 

APIs have prefix `oro`. If you are familiar with CUDA or HIP driver APIs, you will get used to Orochi APIs easily.  

For example, suppose we have the following HIP code for device and context creation:

```
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

hipInit( 0 );
hipDevice device;
hipDeviceGet( &device, 0 );
hipCtx ctx;
hipCtxCreate( &ctx, 0, device );

```


The same code can be rewritten using Orochi as:


```
#include <Orochi/Orochi.h>

oroInitialize( ORO_API_HIP, 0 );
oroInit( 0 );
oroDevice device;
oroDeviceGet( &device, 0 );
oroCtx ctx;
oroCtxCreate( &ctx, 0, device );
```
Which will run on both CUDA and HIP at runtime!

See more in the [sample application](./Test/main.cpp).

## Building Sample Application

Run premake. 

```
./tools/premake5/win/premake5.exe vs2022
```
Note: add the option `--precompiled` to enable precompiled bitcode

Test is a minimum application.

### Test Applications

The test applications run on HIP by default. If you want to run on CUDA, run the app with an arg `cuda`. 

The source code for the test applications can be found [here](./Test/).
